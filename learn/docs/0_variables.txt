#Vaeiables
------------------
The Java programming language defines the following kinds of variables:

• Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields) also known as instance variables because their values are unique to each instance of a class, the currentSpeed of one bicycle is independent from the currentSpeed of another.

• Class Variables (Static Fields) A class variable is any field declared with the static modifier;this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated. A field defining the number of gears for a particular kind of bicycle could be marked as static since conceptually the same number of gears will apply to all instances. The code static int numGears = 6; would create such a static field. Additionally, the keyword final could be added to indicate that the number of gears will never change.

• Local Variables 

• Parameters


#Premitive Data Types in Java
------------------------------------------------
eight primitive data types supported by the Java programming language are:

• byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive).

• short: The short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer. It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive)

• int: By default, the int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer, which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of 2^31-1

• long: The long data type is a 64-bit two's complement integer. The signed long has a minimum value of -2^63 and a maximum value of 2^63-1

• float: The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point

• double: The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point

• boolean: The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false

• char: The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of \u0000 (or 0) and a maximum value of \uffff (or 65,535 inclusive).

the compiler never assigns a default value to an uninitialized local variable. If you cannot initialize your local variable where it is declared, make sure to assign it a value before you attempt to use it. Accessing an uninitialized local variable will result in a compile-time error.

// The number 26, in decimal int decimalValue = 26; 

// The number 26, in hexadecimal int hexadecimalValue = 0x1a; 

// The number 26, in binary int 
binaryValue = 0b11010;
